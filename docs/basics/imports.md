# Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

```go title="imports.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

```text title="Output"
Now you have 2.6457513110645907 problems.
```
